      Rebirth
    </div>
    <div>
      It's been quite some time since I've had a few minutes to sit down and blog, but I feel it's long overdue. I'm looking back through my old posts to find some opinions I no longer hold, and others just solidified by the experiences I've had since. I've been through cycles of front end drama, back end bullshit &amp; dev ops wonder, and through it all my cynicism holds strong. I've found a new love, Golang, but not in a hipster always-chasing-the-latest-tech sort of love. No, this is more born out of the frustrations of working with the tools &amp; languages of the time. I'd have to explain where I've been to understand how I got here though so...

      Well, I've headed up the front end of a team building a rather large Angular 1.x app. Contrary to many complaints about the 'Monolith' that is supposedly Angular, the code base is pretty simple &amp; straight-foward; controllers bind data to the markup, services (that are well tested) handle all the logic and directives &amp; filters help simplify the logic built into the controllers/services/markup. Not that Angular is the tool to solve all problems (no frameworks or languages are for that matter), but it suits this purpose quite well. Which is why I find it so odd that it seems there is a mass exodus of the framework in favour of React; something that smells awfully alot like <a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/07/27/TheChurn.html">the churn</a>, instead of a well thought out upgrade to a better framework. The app itself is written in plain ES5 with shims which, looking back on it now, seems a little rustic.

      Not long after the project was prematurely called a success &amp; thrown to the dogs, we began to build node es6 microservices, services which I have pushed to keep transpilation out of by taking advantage of the features of the later node versions instead of rolling over and accepting babel as a normal process for building node apps. The development experience is much simplier &amp; faster given there is no compilation steps, the debug is cleaner &amp; clearer as there are no sourcemaps to weave back into the debugger and the lack of dependencies on compilation tools means the install time is far quicker &amp; there's no risk of out-dated or deperecated tooling leaking into the project as it ages. The code definitely isn't perfect but in the process I've found an excellent method of testing node apps using mocks and booting up a web server inside of the test process:

      And no, this is not a diary or a place for me to confess my feelings to the world (although you will certainly hear my strong opinions).

      Software developer?
    </div>
    <div class="xs-pt-10">
      I am a software developer for a medium to large (ish) Australian company. Think corporate. I use the term &quot;software&quot; lightly as lately the work I've been doing is centered around web development only. That's not to say I dont fiddle with back-end stuff, or toss together scripts from time-to-time, I just spend most of my day either going through the motions of agile development, or writing web-tier code. Do I hunger for more? possibly. But I am relatively happy where I am (so long as you don't take away my shiny new <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">dev tools</a>).

      People are dumb. God damn people are dumb. By people, I mean the general public. Of course, Anyone savvy enough to find and read this is excluded from that category. But some people should not be allowed to own any technical device. Ever. From my (rather limited) experience, the way I approach any UX problem is by asking myself this very simple question:
    </div>
    <div class="xs-mt-20 t-highlight">
      <blockquote>
        If I had severe brain damage, could I muster the thought capacity to use this?
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      and if the answer is no, you have failed to produce a piece of software that the general public can use. If you think I'm a little jaded, you obviously haven't run into the same issues I have. Or at least you're a helluva lot more calm and rational than I am. Just to list a few:
    </div>
    <div class="xs-pt-10">
      <ul>
        <li>People still think that renaming a file extension on a file converts the file type. This is something that even people in their 20s, who have grown up with computers, still do. This is the veritable equivalent of living in a world full of lemmings. You cannot be that thick and think that it is okay, or that ignorant that you have no idea what you are doing and just do it anyway. Have you tried opening the file? no, no you didn't. You renamed it and sent it on it's merry way. Fuck you.</li>
        <li>People don't understand what a browser is. Holy shit get off the internet before your computer explodes.</li>
        <li>People will install apps and clog the shit out of their devices for the sake of having an app. Use the browser on your device you lazy sloth. Mobile optimized sites are generally 100 times better than the  app because it's far easier and quicker to create a site than it is to create an app, and you don't have more shit on your device creating random, annoying push notifications. If you have installed more than your banking, games &amp; other personal/hobby apps on your phone, you should immediately head to the nearest Apple store and surrender your iPhone. No, you do not need another Personal Trainer/Organiser app. You will survive and prosper without your <a class="hoverhand" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mcd.ui&hl=en" target="_blank">McDonald's app</a>. And you certainly don't need an app to buy a <a target="_blank" class="hoverhand" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.carsales&hl=en">car</a> or a <a target="_blank" class="hoverhand" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fairfax.domain&hl=en">house</a>.

        I'm going to pretend you know what is meant by &quot;jack of all trades&quot;. That's what I am. At least that's what I've been called by co-workers.

      A bit of a backstory: Fresh into University I was so excited to get into the nitty gritty of programming. I imagined my career as a developer sitting in front of a Matrix screen, smashing out code at the speed of light for whatever purpose (I really didn't care why). And I laughed at the idea of being a web developer.
    </div>
    <div class="xs-pt-10"> 
      Fast forward to nearing the end of my studies and I jumped on the first offer I got. And wouldn't you know it, it was a job as a web developer.
    </div> 
    <div class="xs-pt-10">
      Just over a year later, I'm loving it. I'm loving every aspect of it. I love the back end scripting and API writing, I love the styling and animations and user experience. I love my job, and every possible facet of it. But I work in a world where these two areas are split into seperate roles. I currently reside in the back end area of things, toiling away at .NET. However I continue to prod and dabble with front end, increasingly blurring the line between 'Dev' and 'Fed'.

    <div class="xs-pt-20 t-h4">
        So what now?
    </div>
    <div class="xs-pt-10"> 
      Well there you have it. That's my professional life in a nutshell really. I hope I can stick with this 'blogging' thing and continue to comment on/walkthrough my findings as a dev. Even if I don't, I'm sure my curiosities will lead me to rebuild this blog a couple of times.
